# LLM vs. Human Minds

This repository is the result of experiments with LLMs to develop skills in software development using state-of-the-art LLM and popular sources/tools such as langchain, Ollama APi, Openai API...

# Games:
1- Guessing Game

2- Pattern Game

3- Impostor Game (Who is Lying?)

### Game modes
These games have the option of choosing:
- LLM vs. LLM
   : Two virtual players who complement each other
- LLM vs. Human Minds
   : Allows a human to play against a virtual player.

## LLM vs. LLM
In this mode you can choose between several open source models, such as:
Although these models are not prepared for these games, it is an interesting/fun way to compare models, explore their behavior and understand some of their limitations.

## LLM vs. Human Minds
"Can u guess?" This is the game that challenges Human to face LLM models in a variety of games, from guessing to association games... challenge yourself! Will you be able to win?

Who said AI is complex, difficult and scary? In fact AI can also be interesting and fun...  so just relax and exercise your brain and has fun challenging the state of the model ;)

## Setup
- Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
  
         $ python3 -m venv .venv
         $ source .venv/bin/activate
         $ pip install -r requirements.txt
- Download models from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

Optionally (in case of [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api)
- Create account to get your API Key
- Create a .env file with the following variable:
  
        OPENAI_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE]
